    intro: "I help businesses run themselves. I turn complex, manual workflows into seamless, AI-powered systems that save time, reduce errors, and let teams focus on what truly matters. Using tools like n8n, Make, Zapier, and OpenAI, I design automations that work behind the scenes so founders and teams can work smarter, not harder.",
