Version: 1.0 (MVP Spec)
Author: Akhtar (Product) + ChatGPT (PRD)
Status: Ready for Design Guide + Build
Inspiration Reference: toukoum.fr
Build Platform: Antigravity Vibe Coder

1) Product Summary
What are we building?

A chat-first AI portfolio website for Akhtar that looks and feels like a premium interactive landing page. Visitors can:

Ask questions in a chat box (“Ask me anything…”)

Discover Akhtar via 4 clear sections:

Me

Projects

Skills

Contact

Access “common questions” using a 3-dot menu (FAQ prompt launcher)

Experience premium UI interactions:

minimal clean theme

liquid glass buttons

smooth chat animation

cursor fluid effect using SplashCursor component 

splash cursor code

The website should behave like an AI-powered personal assistant, not a generic portfolio.

2) Problem Statement
Why this product?

Traditional portfolios have 3 issues:

Visitors don’t read long text

They want answers quickly (“what do you do?”, “projects?”, “contact?”)

Most portfolios look the same → low memorability

This AI portfolio solves it by:

letting users ask directly instead of searching

showing content in a guided interactive experience

using “chat UI + clean glass design” for a premium feel

3) Goals & Objectives
Business / Career Goals

Position Akhtar as a premium AI automation builder

Attract:

freelance clients

agencies

founders

recruiters

Generate contact conversions:

email clicks

social clicks

direct call/WhatsApp (optional)

Product Goals

Create a portfolio that people remember (visual + interactive)

Make it easy to understand Akhtar within 30 seconds

4) Non-goals (Important scope control)

To avoid wasting time in MVP:

❌ No user login
❌ No “save chats” accounts
❌ No admin panel
❌ No payment/subscriptions
❌ No heavy database design
❌ No multi-language
❌ No blog engine
❌ No complex long-term memory AI system

MVP should feel premium without complexity.

Profile
type Profile = {
  name: string;
  headline: string;
  tagline: string;
  location: string;
  avatarUrl: string;
};

Skills
type SkillsGroup = {
  group: string;
  skills: string[];
};

Project
type Project = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  category: string;
  description: string;
  images: string[]; // exactly 4
  links?: { demo?: string; caseStudy?: string; github?: string };
};

FAQ Prompt
type FAQCategory = {
  title: string;
  questions: string[];
};

Contact
type Contact = {
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  location: string;

    linkedin?: string;
    instagram?: string;
    facebook?: string;
  };
};

17) API Requirements (Gemini / Groq)
Key requirement

User said: no OpenAI, use Gemini or Groq.
So system must support either provider.

Chat API Behavior

Frontend sends:

user message

conversation history (last N messages)

“system prompt” (AI twin personality + truth)

Backend returns:

assistant message

optional tool fields (future)

Response Streaming

MVP should attempt streaming if supported by provider for premium feel.

18) Functional Requirements

✅ All pages route correctly
✅ Chat works with Gemini/Groq
✅ FAQ menu works

✅ Cursor animation integrated
✅ Responsive UI

19) Non-functional Requirements
Performance

no heavy images uncompressed

lazy load project images

keep shaders/canvas optimized

Accessibility

keyboard navigation

Risk: AI hallucination / inventing details

Mitigation:

hard truth source config

“don’t guess” rule

Risk: WebGL performance issues

Mitigation:

disable on mobile low-end

Mitigation:

keep cursor subtle

reduce intensity and alpha
